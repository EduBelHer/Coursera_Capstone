The global pandemic has demonstrated that even as advanced as our civilizations are, we are still not ready to face the worst possible scenarios that may be put in our way. That's why preparation is key, and it's up to us to make the right decisions, with the right data, when the time comes to confront the problems that plague humankind.\n",
